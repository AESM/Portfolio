## Day 01: Data Types! ##
## In programming, a data type is a classification of types of data that
#determine the possible values and operations on that particular type.
## Some typical examples of data types are:
## - int
## - double
## - boolean
## - char
## - String
## - Array
## In languages like Java, data types (like the ones above) can be classified
#into two main groups:
## 1. Primitive Types
## 2. Reference Types
## Take single line inputs and print out if each is an instance of a primitive
#or referenced type as well as which data type it is.
